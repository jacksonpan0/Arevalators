# Arevalators
Arevalators is a 2D maze adventure game in Java using Java graphics. The game is a colorful 8-bit display of a generated character moving around an open space with the option to engage in combat with enemies. Valuable for understanding classes, objects, java graphics, and the interaction of code properties. Some of the code takes inspiration from RyiSnow's Youtube Tutorials. This resource was used on camera implementation and frame refresh rates as a base foundation. Personal changes to the project are mostly everything else, this includes, music, screen change, interaction, and most importantly combat system implementation. Any other issues were resolved solely based on personal experience or through resources found through Google.
